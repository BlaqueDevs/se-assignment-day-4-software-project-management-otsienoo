Avoiding Obsolescence: Understanding trends helps in avoiding technologies or practices that are becoming outdated, ensuring your software remains competitive and up-to-date.
4. Market Positioning and Branding:
Targeting the Right Audience: Market trends can help you identify and segment your target audience more effectively. For example, if a trend indicates that younger users prefer social media integrations, you can position your software to appeal more strongly to this demographic.
